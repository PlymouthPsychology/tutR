## Tutorial attendance

[tutattend.R](tutattend.R) - Does the following, using data drawn from the tutorial attendance monitoring system.

1. Determines pass/fail on tutorial attendance for each student,

2. Calculates mean attendance by module, 

3. Calculates number of missing data points (by tutor). 

4. Checks accuracy of a pass/fail list generated by other means (Excel).

5. Creates visualization of tutorial attendace, with tutorial (1-10) on the x-axis, tutor on the y-axis, size of circle proportional to total number of tutees (at 100% attendance). Colour of circle indicates attendance rate (green: high attendance, red: low attendance). Size of circle is smaller from tutorial 8 onwards, because Stages 2 and 4 only have 7 tutorials, while Stage 1 have 10.
